# fetch
This Discord bot will automatically check for new releases over different GitHub repositories. It was originally designed for [Gorilla Tag](https://gorillatagvr.com) [mods](https://discord.gg/monkemods).

## Installation
### Automatic (Recommended)
For not super-tech-savvy people, configure your information in ``bot_details.py``. Read the gray text for comments. Make sure to install [Python](https://python.org). Open a terminal (Command Prompt) and run:
```
python install.py
```
### Manual
Make sure you have [Python](https://python.org) installed, then open a terminal and run:
```
pip install discord
pip install requests
```

From here, you're all set. Run the bot ``fetch_bot.py`` and you can use these commands:
- ``/setrepo [user] [repo]``: Start tracking a repository. (woah slash commands!)

# fetch
This Discord bot will automatically check for new releases over different GitHub repositories. It was originally designed for [Gorilla Tag](https://gorillatagvr.com) [mods](https://discord.gg/monkemods).
- [Windows](#windows)
- [macOS / Linux](#macos--linux)
## Installation
Make sure you have [Python](https://python.org) installed, then open a terminal and run:
```
pip install discord
pip install requests
```

From here, you're all set. Run the bot and you can use these commands:
- ``/setrepo [user] [repo]``: Start tracking a repository. (woah slash commands!)
